# Url Shortener 1.1.0

**Url Shortener** is an *open source service* made to create shortened links - that's why I've called it Url Shortener.

This has been made using a development version of [Oli, an open source PHP framework](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/) made by [myself](https://github.com/matiboux/).

### Start using it

Download the right version of Oli on [its repository](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/) and extract Oli on your web server!  
Then, [download the KeyGen 1.1.0 release](https://github.com/matiboux/UrlShortener/releases/tag/1.1.0), extract the files in the directory of your Oli website and configure it!

For the configuration part, you can use the **config.json** and **database.sql** files to make things work.  
But don't forget to check the provided values and change some of them (like shortened links in the sql file).

[**But, hey.** *You should know that you could just use the official Url Shortener project on my website*](http://u.matiboux.com/)
