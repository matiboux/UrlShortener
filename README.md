# Url Shortener 2.1.1

**Url Shortener** is an *open source link shortening service*.

This project has been made using the Beta 2.0.0 (dev branch) of [Oli](https://github.com/matiboux/Oli/), an open source PHP framework made by [myself](https://github.com/matiboux/).

### Start using it

Download the right version of Oli from [its repository](https://github.com/matiboux/Oli/) and extract Oli on your web server.  
Then, [download the latest release](https://github.com/matiboux/UrlShortener/releases/latest), extract the files in the directory of your Oli website and configure it!

You'll need to configure your own database and you can use the **database.sql** for its content.

[**But, hey.** *You should know that you could just use the official Url Shortener project on my website*](http://urwebs.it/)
